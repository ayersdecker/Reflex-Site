## Current State

The site currently has only captions enabled. This has been done to showcase a technological prototype for a different project. The site will refer back to its full form around September 7th, 2023. Site is operational, captions working.

## What is this website for?

I am using this website to learn about generating components for the React.js Framework. I will slowly be filling the site out to work as a digital multitool for deaf/hh programmers.

## Tools

- [x] Captions ( Single Request )
- [ ] Clock [Disabled]
- [ ] LoFi Music Streamer [Disabled]
- [ ] Weather [Disabled]
- [ ] Jot Pad / Todo list
- [ ] C# Console Compiler / Debug Embed

## Development

I plan to update this site once a week, usually around Monday - Tuesday afternoon
